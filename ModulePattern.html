  // The module pattern is a good way to encapsulate your JavaScript functions
  // and properties.  The example below shows how to create a module, namespace
  // it, and specify public/private properties and functions.

  // Be aware that the Module Pattern is NOT generally used for object-oriented
  // programming.  It does not give you the ability to define a class that can
  // spawn objects based on its definition.  Although it is possible to jerry
  // rig the Module Pattern to define classes, there isn't a real benefit to
  // doing this as JavaScript has another facility for this.

  // If you are more interested in laying out a classical object-oriented
  // hierarchy, look at this example instead:
  // https://github.com/stevekwan/experiments/blob/master/javascript/class.html

  // However, be aware that JavaScript is not a classically object-oriented
  // language.  If you are trying to write true classical OOP in JavaScript,
  // you're probably doing it wrong.  :)

  // Advantages of the Module Pattern:
  // -Avoids nonsense with the "this" keyword, which often causes confusion
  // -Gives you basic encapsulation without having to write a lot of code
  // -If you are creating a singleton "class," the Module Pattern is for you.

  // Disadvantages of the Module Pattern:
  // -True class-based OOP doesn't work well with the Module Pattern.

  // First, let's create a namespace.  It's not required, but it's usually a
  // good idea.
  var MyNamespace = MyNamespace || {};

  // Let's add our module to the namespace.  Basically, it's just a property of
  // the namespace.  Note that our module is actually a function.  We're going
  // to use JavaScript closures to emulate private methods, which are not
  // natively part of JavaScript.
  MyNamespace.MyModule = function()
  {

    // Let's define a private and public property.  Note that we define them in
    // exactly the same way.  The bit that specifies whether they are
    // public/private comes later...
    var myPrivateProperty = 2;
    var myPublicProperty = 1;

    // Let's declare a simple private function.
    var myPrivateFunction = function()
    {
      console.log("myPrivateFunction()");
    };

    // Now let's declare a public function.  Again, note that the function
    // definition is exactly the same as the private one.
    var myPublicFunction = function()
    {
      console.log("myPublicFunction()");

      // Just for fun, let's call our private function.  Note that while we are
      // inside the module, we have full access to all Module properties and
      // functions, just like if we were inside a class.
      myPrivateFunction();
    };

    // Let's make a setup function for this module: something that is called
    // once when it's loaded.  I generally like to call my setup functions
    // init().
    var init = function()
    {
      // Do some setup stuff
      console.log("init()");
    };

    // This is the part that separates the private and public stuff.  Anything
    // in this object becomes public.  Anything NOT in this object becomes
    // private.
    var oPublic =
    {
      init: init,
      myPublicProperty: myPublicProperty,
      myPublicFunction: myPublicFunction
    };

    return oPublic;
  }();
  // This is the interesting part: we are returning our oPublic interface, and
  // immediately invoking our MyModule function with the () at the end.

  // We do this because we are not actually saving the function we created; we
  // are saving the RESULT of the function.  The () makes us immediately call
  // the function, and it is the result we save.  The original function itself
  // is discarded...but its contents live on via JavaScript closures!

  // MyModule is not the function we have defined; rather, it is the result of
  // an anonymous function that was called once and discarded.  Because that
  // function doesn't have a name, we can't refer to its internal properties
  // directly.  And that's why the properties NOT in the oPublic interface
  // become private.  :)

  // Let's call our setup function....
  console.log("Calling init()...");
  MyNamespace.MyModule.init();

  // And our public function.  Internally, this will call myPrivateFunction.
  // This wil work because it's being called from inside the module.
  console.log("Calling myPublicFunction()...");
  MyNamespace.MyModule.myPublicFunction();

  // This will throw an error because myPrivateFunction() is not accessible
  // from outside the module.
  console.log("Calling myPrivateFunction()...");
  MyNamespace.MyModule.myPrivateFunction();
